		<h1> The Tuition Problem</h1>
		<h2>Article 26 of the human rights states</h2>
		<h3>"Everyone has the right to education. Education shall be free, at least in the elementary and fundamental stages." 
</h3> 
<p>I believe college should be free just as the other grades of school are. Not everyone can afford tuition and financial aid only helps but so much. I myself wasn't able to completely cover the tuition with financial aid and if it wasn't for the ASAP program here at BMCC id have to still pay out of pocket for the rest of the tuition.
</p>
<p> This immage below shows the situation we are and The government is the one with the key and we have to convince them to unlock college level education for all
